# HOW TO RUN TESTS

These tests provide partial coverage for the Udacity Feed Reader web application.
The Feed reader take in a set list of RSS feeds and display the titles from those on the page. You can change feeds by clicking on a new feed within the menu.

The tests are written in Jasmine, and for this project are part of Jasmine's [standalone distribution](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html). You do not need to install Node.js to run these tests.

To run these tests you will need to open the index.html page. At the bottom of this page you will see all available tests.
Tests are stored in the ./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file.
